I started off this project by looking at the mock up provided and did the wireframing.
After I had a layout design, I structured the html with divs and bootsrtap within.
I always seem to have trouble with the css so it takes me longer than what I would like.
After that the biggest hurdle for me was getting the user input to get the API data.
After hours of tinkering with the format, I was able to log the data from a city entered into the devtools log.
Unfortunatley I ran out of time and wasnt able to display the info in the html.
